This Poverty Reduction Progress Report is the seventh in a series of yearly reports delivered by the World Bank's management to 
its Board of Executive Directors to update them on progress made in decreasing poverty and increasing the poverty focus and 
impact of Bank activities. The paper was created by the Reduction and Economic Management Network's Poverty Reduction Group (PREM). 
It is the result of extensive consultations with staff from other Bank groups and networks, 
as well as conversations with the Board's Development Effectiveness Committee and the entire Board of Executive Directors.
