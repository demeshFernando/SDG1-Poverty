                Belgium shares borders with France (620 km), Germany (167 km),
                Luxembourg (148 km) and the Netherlands (450 km). Its total
                surface, including water area, is 30,689 km2
                (11,849 sq mi). Before
                2018, its total area was believed to be 30,528 km2
                (11,787 sq mi).
                However, when the country's statistics were measured in 2018, a
                new calculation method was used. Unlike previous calculations,
                this one included the area from the coast to the low-water line,
                revealing the country to be 160 km2
                (62 sq mi) larger in surface
                area than previously thought. Its land area alone is
                30,278 km2
                .
                It lies between latitudes 49°30' and 51°30' N, and
                longitudes 2°33' and 6°24' E.
                Belgium has three main geographical regions; the coastal plain in
                the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo Belgian Basin, and the Ardennes uplands in the southeast to the
                Hercynian orogenic belt. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth
                area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.
                The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape
                irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine (Kempen).
                The thickly forested hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges.
                Extending westward into France, this area is eastwardly connected to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau,
                on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country's highest point at 694 m (2,277 ft).

                Belgium's strongly globalized economy[105] and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of Europe. Its

                the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world's 15th largest trading nation in
                2007. The economy is

                characterized by a highly productive work force, high GNP and high exports per
                capita. Belgium's main imports are raw

                equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, and

                The Belgian economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature: a dynamic Flemish economy and a
                Walloon

                economy that lags behind.
                One of the founding members of the European Union, Belgium strongly
                supports an open economy

                Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the Industrial
                Revolution, in the early 19th century. 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                Areas in Liège Province and around
                Charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the

                in Belgium to remain low.
                Currently, the poverty rate in Belgium rests at 15 percent. Like many other European nations, Belgium has a high standard of living and per capita income. Belgium consistently ranks among the top nations in the Human Development Index (an index that measures the quality of life in countries). In 2007, Belgium ranked number seven, which was ahead of the country it once was a part of — the Netherlands.
                When measured in 1992, 3.7 percent of the population was in the lowest 10 percent of the income bracket. About 9.5 percent were in the lowest 20 percent, 14.6 percent were in the second 20 percent, 18.4 percent were in the third 20 percent and 23 percent were in the fourth 20 percent of income.
                The highest 20 percent made up 34.5 percent and the highest 10 percent made up 20.2 percent of income. These statistics indicate the low poverty rate in Belgium and the little income inequality.
                Although there is little income inequality in Belgium, 16.7 percent of people under the age of 18 lived in families that fell below the poverty line. Since 2012, the risk of being under the poverty line for people under the age of 18 has decreased considerably. Thanks to numerous social welfare programs, the risk of a person under 18 being under the poverty line in Belgium has fallen from 27 to 15 percent.
                The social welfare system is a primary reason for why the poverty rate in Belgium remains low. The country has programs for family allowance, retirement, medical benefits, unemployment insurance and even a program that provides a salary in the event of an illness.
                Belgium is a country that has managed to tackle the issues of income inequality and poverty while remaining a small nation. The social welfare system in Belgium in conjunction with its cooperation with the EU and NATO are one of the primary reasons for the success of the country. Thus, countries interested in lowering their poverty rates should follow Belgium’s example.

            <h1 id="h1">More than 4.5 million Belgians unable to save money</h1>

            <p>
                In 2020, 4,622,000 Belgians were unable to save during a typical month. This corresponds to 40.8% of the population. 32.8% of Belgians could barely make ends meet with their monthly income, 6.1% had to use available savings and 1.9% had to borrow money. This is according to new results published by Statbel, the Belgian statistical office, on the occasion of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The figures come from the 2020 survey on income and living conditions (EU-SILC), in which more than 7,000 Belgian households were questioned about their indebtedness and standard of living.
            </p>

            <h1 id="h1">Saving up is not something everyone can take for granted</h1>

            <p>
                In 2020, 59.2% of Belgians were able to save during a typical month. In Flanders, 68.1% were able to save. This figure drops to 50.4% in Brussels and 46.1% in Wallonia.
                However, the picture is quite different when we look at the situation of the 18.9% of Belgians who are considered to be at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) and the others.
                22.1% of Belgians at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) were able to save, while 60.9% just about managed to make ends meet, 10.9% even had to use savings and 6.1% had to borrow to make ends meet.
                Of the fellow Belgians who were not at risk of poverty or social exclusion, 67.9% were able to save, 26.3% were just getting by, 4.9% needed savings, and another 0.9% had to borrow.
            </p>

            <h1 id="h1">More than one in three households cannot survive long on savings</h1>

            <p>
                The Statbel survey also asked households about the hypothetical situation in which their household would have no income, and would therefore have to draw on their savings. 40.3% of Belgians are unable to continue living with to the same standard of living for more than three months. 21% can sustain the same standard of living between 3 and 6 months, 13.1% say they can continue for 6 to 12 months with their savings and another 25.7% can sustain the same standard of living for more than a year with savings.
                Here, too, are regional differences: 57.6% and 55.6% of the inhabitants of Brussels and Wallonia respectively cannot rely on their savings for more than three months. In Flanders, this share is limited to 28.6%.
                The margin is the least wide among Belgians who are unemployed, where 72.8% indicate that they will not be able to continue living with the same standard of living for more than three months. Among Belgians living in a single-parent family, the proportion is 70.6%, among renters it is 69.2% and among low-skilled people 52.5%.
                Belgians who belong to the risk group for poverty or social exclusion clearly have less margin: 74.6% would not be able to continue with the same standard of living for three months, 11.3% would manage between 3 and 6 months, 5.3% between 6 and 12 months and 8.8% would be able to sustain the same standard of living for more than a year.
                Of the population not in this risk group, still 32.2% would be able to bridge less than three months, 23.2% between 3 and 6 months, 14.9% between 6 and 12 months and 28.4% more than 12 months.
