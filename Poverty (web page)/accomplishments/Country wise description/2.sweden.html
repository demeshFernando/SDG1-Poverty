                Situated in northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic sea and gulf of bothnia, 
                providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian peninsula. To the 
                west is the Scandinavian mountain chain (Skanderna), a range that separates sweden from norway, 
                finland is located to its north-east. It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, 
                Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and it is also linked to Denmark(south-west) by the 
                Oresund bridge. Its border with Norway is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe.
                Sweden lies between latitudes 55o and 70o N, and mostly between longitudes 11o and 25o E 
                (part of stora drammen island is just west of 110). 
                At 449,964 km2 sweden is the 55th largest country in the world, the fifth &#8211; largest country in 
                europe, and the largest country in northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the ba 
                of lake hammarsjon, near Kristianstad, at -2.41 m (-7.91 ft) below sea level. The highest point 
                is Kebnekaise at 2,111 m(6,926 ft) above sear level. 
                Sweden is the sixteenth richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) 
                per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens. Sweden is an export &#8211; 
                oriented mixed economy. Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resourse base of an 
                economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade. Sweden&apos;s engineering sector accounts for 50% of 
                output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharamaceutical 
                industries are also of great importance, Sweden is the ninth &#8211; largest arms exporter in the 
                world. Agriculture accounts for 2% GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest for 
                tephone and internet access penetration.
                The total resident population of Sweden was 10,377 in October 2020. The population exceeded to 
                10 million for the first time on Friday 20 january 2017.

                        Absolute poverty can also be described with the terms "Low income standard" and 
                        "absolute poverty line". The limit for absolute poverty is usually equated with an 
                        income corresponding to the level of income support. Just over half a million people, 
                        570,000 or 6% of the population live in absolute poverty in Sweden.

                    <h2 id="h1">"Risk of poverty" / "relative poverty" </h2>

                    <p>
                        Risk of poverty is also called relative poverty or "low economic standard". This means 
                        having less than 60% of the country's median income, which in 2019 corresponded to a 
                        monthly income of SEK 12,248 after tax, including any housing supplement. About 1.7 
                        million people, 17.1% in Sweden, live at risk of poverty.

            <h2 id="h1">Poverty over time</h2>

            <p>
                Over a ten-year period, poverty in Sweden has increased. It is the consequence of conscious 
                political changes in the welfare systems that have been implemented during the period. That 
                1.8 million, ie close to a fifth of the population, live in or at risk of poverty is not decent 
                in a welfare state like Sweden. Unfortunately, we can state that this problem is not paid enough 
                attention. The causes of rising poverty must be combated. Everyone, not just a few, must 
                benefit from welfare. The groups of people who, in relation to the general population, 
                are often poor
            </p>

            <h2 id="h1">Poor who are not visible at all</h2>

            <p>
                A group of the poor who are increasingly taking up space in the public sphere are undocumented 
                refugees and EU migrants. They reside in Sweden without having a population registration 
                address and are therefore not included in the official statistics published by Statistics 
                Sweden. The people who do not have a permanent home, work illegally or for some other reason 
                "stay away", are also not visible in the official statistics. This means that the number of 
                people who are poor in Sweden is higher than official statistics show.
            </p>

            <h2 id="h1">How many are poor </h2>

            <p>
                Sweden's total population in September 2020 was 10.4 million. Depending on how you count, 
                between half a million and almost 2 million or more are poor in Sweden. However you choose to 
                count, the conclusion is that there are unacceptable numbers. We must work together to ensure 
                that the number of people in poverty does not increase but decreases

            <h1 id="h1">The Swedish labor market and minimum wage</h1>
            <h2 id="h1">What is the problem? </h2>

            <p>
                In Europe, there are many countries where employee safety is severely curtailed. Many are 
                exploited with employment conditions and wages that are far below the poverty line. Employment 
                security is also weak. In Sweden, there are also problems in the labor market. Although most
                workplaces are covered by collective agreements between employers and the trade unions, there 
                are workplaces that do not have this. Not even the "law" always reaches these workplaces. 
                Within the EU, a proposal from the European Commission for a directive on minimum wages in 
                EU member states is currently being considered. This as part of the fight against poverty 
                and unworthy living conditions. EAPN Sweden has, to the best of its ability, followed the 
                discussion and acted on the issue because it is important for EAPN, both at European level and 
                in Sweden.
