            <h1>What is the Poverty</h1>
            <p>Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. Poverty means that the income level from employment is so low that basic human needs can't be met. Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper housing, clean water, healthy food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own criteria for determining how many of its people are living in poverty.</p>

        <h1>Factors of Poverty</h1>
        <p>Access to good schools, healthcare, electricity, safe water, and other critical services remains elusive for many and is often determined by socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, and geography. For those able to move out of poverty, progress is often temporary. Economic shocks, food insecurity, and climate change threaten their gains and may force them back into poverty.<br>Poverty is a difficult cycle to break and often passes from one generation to the next. Typical consequences of poverty include alcohol and substance abuse, limited access to education, poor housing and living conditions, and increased levels of disease. Heightened poverty is likely to cause increased tensions in society as inequality increases. These issues often lead to rising crime rates in communities affected by poverty.</p>

        <h1>Poverty and children</h1>
        </div>
        <p>The impact of poverty on children is substantial. Children who grow up in poverty typically suffer from severe and frequent health problems; infants born into poverty have an increased chance of low birth weight, which can lead to physical and mental disabilities.<br>

            In some impoverished countries, poverty-stricken infants are nine times more likely to die in their first month compared to babies born in high-income countries.910 Those who live may have hearing and vision problems.<br>
            
            Children in poverty tend to miss more school due to sickness and endure more stress at home. Homelessness is particularly hard on children because they often have little to no access to healthcare and lack proper nutritionâ€”which often results in frequent health issues.</p>

                <h3> Absolute poverty</h3>
                <p>Also known as extreme poverty or abject poverty, it involves the scarcity of basic food, clean water, health, shelter, education and information. Those who belong to absolute poverty tend to struggle to live and experience a lot of child deaths from preventable diseases like malaria, cholera and water-contamination related diseases. Absolute Poverty is usually uncommon in developed countries.</p>

        <h1>Poverty Of Sri Lanka</h1>
        <p>
            Poverty in Sri Lanka is 4%. Sri Lanka's life expectancy and literacy rate are nearly on par with those of developed countries, and even top the rankings for the South Asia region.While all these indicate that Sri Lanka should be experiencing a high standard of living, until recently it has only ranked in the medium category of the Human Development Index.This is despite the fact that Sri Lanka has been experiencing moderate growth in its GDP averaging 5.5 per annum between 2006 and 2009.One of the reasons is due to its relatively low GDP per capital;.The Sri Lankan government has been successful in reducing poverty from 15.2% on 2006 to 8.9% in 2010, urban poverty was reduced from 6.7 to 5.3% while rural poverty was reduced from 15.7 to 9.5%, and the nation has made significant progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.


         <ul>
             <li>In Sri Lanka, 4.1% of the population lives below the national poverty line in 2016.</li>
             <li>In Sri Lanka, the proportion of employed population below $1.90 purchasing power parity a day in 2019 is 0.4%.</li>
             <li>For every 1,000 babies born in Sri Lanka in 2019, 7 die before their 5th birthday.</li>
