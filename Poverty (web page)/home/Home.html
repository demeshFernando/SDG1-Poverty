      <p class="title">What is poverty</p>
      <p class="sub_title">
          When you think about poverty, what comes to mind? It’s probably an image of a person who doesn’t have enough (good) food to eat, lives in a shabby home—or no home at all. And they probably can’t afford to buy the goods and services you normally take for granted. You’re not wrong, but the complexity of poverty may surprise you.
          <br>Poverty is not just about money, but also includes issues of access to services such as health care and education, marginalization and exclusion. Learn about these complexities and how World Vision has been partnering with donors to reduce poverty in the world’s most vulnerable places.

        “We are living in a phenomenal age. If we can spend the early decades of the 21st century finding approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits and recognition for business, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce poverty in the world.”

        “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.”
